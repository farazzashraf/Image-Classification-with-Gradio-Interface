# Flower Classification with Convolutional Neural Network and Gradio

This repository contains a Python script for a flower classification task using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. The code loads a flower dataset, preprocesses the data, trains the CNN model, and provides a web-based interface for making predictions with the trained model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of various types of flowers, including daisies, dandelions, roses, sunflowers, and tulips. The dataset is organized into subfolders, each representing a different flower category. In this example, there are a total of 50 images, with 38 used for training and 12 for validation.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model used for flower classification consists of several convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is designed to learn and recognize features in the flower images to make accurate predictions.

## Making Predictions

After training the model, you can make predictions on new flower images using the Gradio interface. Upload an image, and the model will provide the top predicted flower classes.
